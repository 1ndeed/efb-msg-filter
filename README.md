# efb-msg-filter
Filter Only Shoudao Message Only for EQS.  
It's very poorly written, works only with EQS. If you have EWS, it might NOT function normally!!!  
It blocks "收到" message from group chat. Messages from private chat won't be effected at all.  
If you wish to block other message from group chat, there isn't a conf file for now. You can fork this repository the rewrite it. Or you can simply add another if in the script.
